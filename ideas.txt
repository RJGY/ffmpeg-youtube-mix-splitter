from difflib import SequenceMatcher

def similar(a, b):
    return SequenceMatcher(None, a, b).ratio()

gonna need this to be able to see how similar a video is compared to the title? if its like 60% similar then send it i guess???
maybe a better scoring system like if its a longer titled video can be less strict but shorter need to be stricter???
